# 404_Dashboard

> _Yaay, what the world´s been waiting for.. finally another trello/meistertask derivate, brilliant, li´l bonobo. Added confetti already?_

Background story: I was annoyed by my meistertask subscription - again. Way too expensive AND no access to my dashboards, also no feedback from customer support, what else is new. So I opted IMHH (= In My Humble Hybris) to reinvent the wheel, i.e. try to create a dashboard for my beloved `wonderClass` to share + storage accquired knowledge, to inspire each other, to schedule projects to come, to.. whatever.
